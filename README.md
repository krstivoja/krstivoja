## About

ðŸŽ“ Currently I am Keeping [Scandic Hotels Booking system](https://www.scandichotels.se/) for more than 270 hotels into shape through the Web and App.</br>
ðŸŒ± Builing [dPlugins hub](https://dplugins.com/). as my side project.</br>
ðŸŽ¯ My Goal is to build WordPress Plugins & Tutorials to ensure your workflow works.</br>
âœ¨ I love to create collaborating, researching, reading and spending time with my family.</br>

### With 21 years of experience, I cover a wide range of skills.

But I do not think it's so much about what you know. It's about how you share.

I am a warm person with a "we can do this" attitude who likes to share what he knows and is always willing to learn more and adapt. I enjoy working in teams and have a bit of OCD that everything has to be organized. I like creative masses on my desk from time to time, but never in files and structures.

### The last 5 years in Sweden
I am currently working in Sweden as an art director / product designer for a hotel company that is one of the largest hotel chains in Scandinavia with more than 280 hotels. I am currently developing an app and an e-commerce website, which has been nominated as one of the best e-commerce websites in the Scandinavian market in 2019.

Our app has increased its rating from 2.9 to 4.0 in 6 months during the time I have been working here!!!

### Besides office work I am active in the WordPress community
As a team leader, we have developed one of the most advanced code editors for WordPress.
I am constantly posting creative code snippets and helping others evolve and learn from them.
In 2016, I moved to Sweden to work on an app generator for video publishing apps. This generator generates apps for: " iOS, tvOS, Android, Android TV, Roku, Fire TV, Web, Chromecast. "I worked as a senior product designer on UX and UI. I managed to make it all happen by sketching out a strong and clear design system and sitting with the developers every day, trying to sell edge gasses along the way.


### Life in Serbia. Before my family and I moved here
I was a freelancer for the last 5 years in Serbia and I was working offshore for Switzerland companies. True the user For the last 5 years I have been freelancing in Serbia and working abroad for Swiss companies. Within user research, wireframing and final production I delivered advertising website and ads for homepage and banners for the biggest Swiss telecommunication company Swisscom. Besides Swisscom, I also delivered SRF modules (broadcast video and radio) for a website for the Olympic Games in Sochi. Micro website for Six payments and Helsana.

In addition to Mirco websites, I have experience with the admin panel for a client that manufactures tracking loggers that are transported in containers by ships across the ocean, and the admin panel for medical device automation.

My last agency in Serbia was Razor agency in Belgrade for the Irish market.
I worked there as a lead designer and one of the biggest clients was Knorr. I had to do the art direction for their events in Ireland.

The first big company was Publicis Groupe in Belgrade in 2003. There I did campaign adaptations for Coca-Cola and campaigns for VIP, the leading telecom provider in Serbia and the Balkans.

I worked for local design agencies in 1999 in the small town where I was born.
